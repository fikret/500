# 500 Page

Cloudflare lets us customize our 500 page by giving it the address of a static page. They then upload it somehow,
which is why I think it's best to keep this minimal, especially since we have to be in pretty bad shape if
readers are seeing this page.

From the Cloudflare docs:

To customize your 500 Class Errors page, design your custom HTML page and make sure to include the required token. Then host it online (it may be hosted anywhere). Once you publish your custom page, CloudFlare will use your customized page instead of serving our standard 500 Class Errors page to your visitors on 502, 504, and 52x errors. The maximum customized page size is 1.5 MB.

I'm not sure whether we'll have to put this on the cdn separately or not.
