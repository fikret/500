# 500 Page

Cloudflare lets us customize our 500 page by giving it the address of a static page. In order to show any changes to
the branch, you'll have to republish the page in the Cloudflare.

If readers are seeing this page, the site's in pretty bad shape, so we shouldn't include a nav bar or direct
them anywhere that's just going to error out again. Hence the Twitter feed.

From the Cloudflare docs: The maximum customized page size is 1.5 MB.

index file in the admin.
