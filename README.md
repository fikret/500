# 500 Page

Cloudflare lets us customize our 500 page by giving it the address of a static page. In order to show any changes to
the branch, you'll have to republish the page in the Cloudflare.

If readers are seeing this page, the site's in pretty bad shape, so we shouldn't include a nav bar or direct
them anywhere that's just going to error out again. Hence the Twitter feed.

From the Cloudflare docs: The maximum customized page size is 1.5 MB.


### deploying

From the Cloudflare admin, find the 500 page section. Choose 'customize' and put the url of the raw
index file in the admin.

### styling

An example of the HTML generated by the 500 token is as follows (presumably the content changes according to which 500 error):

```html
<div class="cf-error-details cf-error-522">
  <h1>Connection timed out</h1>
  <p data-translate="connection_timed_out">The initial connection between CloudFlare's network and the origin web server timed out. As a result, the web page can not be displayed.</p>
  <ul class="cferror_details">
    <li>Ray ID: 000000000000000</li>
    <li>Your IP address: 71.41.155.50</li>
    <li>Error reference number: 522</li>
    <li>CloudFlare Location: San Jose</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```
